see what happens   he said ',\n ' i do not think this was designed for me  anyhow ',\n 'this was designed for the future generation of players  ',\n 'argentina and britain received wild cards to the

millennium ',\n ' it seems pretty friendly right now   said davenport ',\n ' i think there is a really nice environment and a great atmosphere  especially between some of the veteran players helping some of the younger players out ',\n ' it s a very pleasant atmosphere  i d have to say  around the locker rooms ',\n ' i felt like the best weeks that i had to get to know players when i was playing were the fed cup weeks or the olympic weeks  not necessarily during the tournaments ',\n ' and even though maybe we had smaller teams  i still think we kept to ourselves quite a bit ',\n ' not always  but i really feel like in the mid      years there was a huge shift of the attitudes of the top players and being more friendly and being more giving  and a lot of that had to do with players like roger coming up ',\n ' i just felt like it really kind of changed where people were a little bit  definitely in the   s  a lot more quiet  into themselves  and then it started to become better  ',\n 'meanwhile  federer is hoping he can improve his service game as he hunts his ninth swiss indoors title this week ',\n ' i didn t serve very well  against first round opponent filip kranjovic

have ended very quickly today  even though i didn t have the best serve percentage stats ',\n ' but maybe that s exactly what caught up to me eventually ',\n 'it s just getting used to it ',\n 'this

practice ',\n 'the paris masters draw has been made and nadal will start his campaign on tuesday or wednesday against either fernando verdasco or jeremy chardy ',\n 'nadal could then play defending champion jack sock in the third round before a potential quarter final with either borna coric or dominic thiem ',\n 'nadal s appearance in paris is a big boost to the tournament organisers who could see roger federer withdraw ',\n 'federer is in action at the swiss indoors in basel and if he reaches the final  he could pull out of paris in a bid to stay fresh for london ',\n 'but as it stands  federer is in the draw and is scheduled to face either former world no   milos raonic or jo wilfried tsonga in the second round ',\n 'federer s projected route to the paris final could also lead to matches against kevin anderson and novak djokovic ',\n 'djokovic could play marco cecchinato in the second round ',\n 'british no   kyle edmund is the   th seed in paris and will get underway in round two against either karen khachanov or filip krajinovic ',\n 'tennis giveth  and tennis taketh away ',\n 'the end of the season is finally in sight  and with so many players defending or losing huge

storylines  aside from the matches  of course  has been the on court coaching debate ',\n 'nina and irina give their opinions on what coaching should look like in the future  on both tours         ',\n 'federer won the swiss indoors last week by beating romanian qualifier marius copil in the final ',\n 'the    year old claimed his   th atp title and is hunting the century in the french capital this week ',\n 'federer has been handed a difficult draw where could could come across kevin anderson  novak djokovic and rafael nadal in the latter rounds ',\n 'but first the    time grand slam winner wants to train on the paris masters court this afternoon before deciding whether to appear for his opening match against either milos raonic or jo wilfried tsonga ',\n ' on monday  i am free and will look how i feel   federer said after winning the swiss indoors ',\n ' on tuesday i will fly to paris and train in the afternoon to be ready for my first match on wednesday night ',\n ' i felt good all week and better every day ',\n ' we also had the impression that at this stage it might be better to play matches than to train ',\n ' and as long as i fear no injury  i play  ',\n 'federer s success in basel last week was the ninth time he has won his hometown tournament ',\n 'and he was delighted to be watched on by all of his family and friends as he purchased    tickets for the final

with the emotions  sometimes i just stumble ',\n ' it means the world to me ',\n 'it makes me incredibly happy to win my home tournament and make people happy here ',\n ' i do not know if it s maybe my last title  so today i try a lot more to absorb that and enjoy the moments much more consciously ',\n ' maybe i should celebrate as if it were my last title ',\n ' there are very touching moments
